# Replication-Project

This repository includes the materials required to reproduce my final year psychology research project which investigated replicability. 

The research report used data from Camerer et al. (2018) to check their results were reproducible. This involved recoding the Stata code (paid for statistical software) written by Camerer et al. (2018) into R code (open source statistical software).

Additionally, a Z-curve analysis was done on the data, which gave information on the amount of publication bias in original studies and the replicability of the original studies.
